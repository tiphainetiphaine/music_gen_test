This application tests the [Shutterstock music generation API](https://www.shutterstock.com/developers/documentation/custom-music), creating multiple renders in sync for multiple themes, for your choice of length of audio.

These are "cinematic_minimal_tense" and "documentary_underscore_heartfelt"

Once rendered these will be available to play in the browser
